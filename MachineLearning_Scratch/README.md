# Machine Learning From Scratch


As a student of Carnegie Mellon University, I studied Machine Learning from the Machine Learning Department and the code files here are some of my samples of building Machine Learning Algorithms for Scratch using only numpy library.

The Algorithms Covered are as follows :

1) n-layer Decision Tree
2) Logistic Regression for Sentiment Analysis
3) 2 Hidden Layer Neural Network
4) Hidden Markov Model using forwardbackward
